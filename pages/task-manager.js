            <p>This application is a CRUD task manager built with Rails following a Udemy course. It implements login/logout and to-do list management using the standard MVC Rails architecture. I added a daily/weekly reminder feature that sends scheduled emails as well, shown to the right. This project was primarily done as a way to familiarize myself with software development using Ruby on Rails, which has been my primary responsibility at Corporate Traditions.</p>
